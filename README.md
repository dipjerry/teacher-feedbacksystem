The feedback Analysis system is a project which web-based feedback collecting system from an XLSX file created from google form and analyze them. It provides automatic generation of feedback that is given by the students. We have developed it to provide feedback quickly and easily to the college faculty, which delivers the feedback to the respective teacher.</p>

By using this technology we can give feedback in an online system as fast as compared to the existing paper feedback portal. 
Overall this project of ours is being developed to help to know the overall performance of a teacher in the best way possible and also reduce the human effort
